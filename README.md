# Egg Price Case Study
## Hook and Rubric
The [CS3 Hook] document outlines the case study. The [CS3 Rubric] document gives more detail to the study including requirements about the formatting, submission, written report, and repository. These documents should provide all of the information needed to successfully complete the case study and should be read carefully.  

## Data
The DATA folder contains the [Egg Price CSV](https://github.com/KAdH12/DS4002_CS3/blob/main/DATA/egg%20prices.csv) required for the case study as well as a [Data Appendix](https://github.com/KAdH12/DS4002_CS3/blob/main/DATA/data_appendix.pdf) with more information about the file. 

## Code
The CODE folder contains the [Egg Price ARIMA](https://github.com/KAdH12/DS4002_CS3/blob/main/CODE/EggPrice_ARIMA.ipynb) script which gives an example of the code and resulting output for the time series analysis. 

## Resources
The RESOURCES folder contains two articles that should be helpful to reference for the case study. The [first article](https://github.com/KAdH12/DS4002_CS3/blob/main/RESOURCES/US%20egg%20prices%20increase%20to%20record%20high%2C%20dashing%20hopes%20of%20cheap%20eggs%20by%20Easter%20_%20AP%20News.pdf) is from AP News and gives some background about rising egg prices such as the causes and recent trends. The [second article](https://github.com/KAdH12/DS4002_CS3/blob/main/RESOURCES/The%20Complete%20Guide%20to%20Time%20Series%20Forecasting%20Models%20_%20by%20Peter%20Wainaina%20_%20Medium.pdf) is from Medium and gives a pretty detailed overview to time series modeling. It does not include any code (this can be found in the CODE folder) but explains the concepts and how to analyze the results.
